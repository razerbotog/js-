### Notes
- JavaScript is often described as a "prototype-based" language, which is a specific form of object-oriented programming.

## Object 
- Collections of propeties & methods
## Parts of OOP
Object Literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 Pillars
**Abstraction** :*You can use abstraction to hide the internal implementation details of an object and expose only the relevant information or methods.*

**Encapsulation** : *You can encapsulate data and behavior within objects. This means you can define properties and methods that are specific to an object, and they won't interfere with properties and methods of other objects.*

**Inheritance** : *JavaScript supports prototype-based inheritance, which allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. This allows for code reuse and helps in creating hierarchies of objects.*


**Polymorphism** : *avaScript allows you to create objects with the same interface (i.e., the same methods or properties) but with different underlying implementations. This is a fundamental aspect of polymorphism in OOP.*
